# EnableBitLockerSaveKeytoAD
<br>
Powershell script that enabled Bitlocker and saves key to AD<br>
I've created two Powershell scripts; one for physical machines and one for virtual machines<br>
Bitlock.ps1 - for physical and HyperV VMs<br>
Bitlock-VM.ps1 - for virtual machines only<br>
REVISED: I've got this working for both Hyper-V VMs and physical devices so no need to have both scripts.
